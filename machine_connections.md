# Machine Connections

## Power

> I am not a licensed Electrician, consult with one prior to connecting your machine. Machine damage, death and injury can result from inexperienced electrical work.

X7 Machines come in [Three Phase](#3-phase-power30-Phase-Power) and [Single Phase](#singe-phase-powerSingle-Phase-Power) configurations. You connections will vary. It is recommend or prepare your electrician to do an initial review so as to order the required materials.

The X7 does not come with a "cord" that one plugs in. Cable must be run from your power source to the machine or transformer and then to the machine depending on your specific configuration.

### 3 Phase Power

Most X7 machines are sold as 220v 3 Phase. Ensure you have a 30 amp **minimum** dedicated circuit. **SYIL recommends a 50 amp dedicated breaker**. Wiring from your panel to machine must be properly selected for the rated amperage and voltages.

3 Phase power can be run from source. As example this might be a wall disconnect to the SYIL Transformer. While the machine is sold as 220v it actually requires 380v and SYIL can include a transform to step up voltage. A vinal connection it then made from the transformer to the SYIL electronics cabinet. Consider having your electrician add appropriate connectors inline of the cables to allow you to move either the machine or transformer without having to disconnect cables from terminals. While the SYIL does have a power switch the transformer does not. Decide to have an on-off switch like a wall disconnect box or plan on turning off the circuit at your panel breaker.

#### Cables

All cables must be correctly installed to terminal blocks in the wall disconnect, transformer and SYIL Electronics cabinet with cable ferrules or terminals.

**Do Not connect cables with bare copper wire or solder wired ends to terminal blocks.**

3 Phase cables will have 4 conductors jacketed in a durable outer casing. Each conductor is often in a colored insulator. IT is common for these to be Black, Red, White and Green.
Red and Black are the "Hot" conductors, White is Neutral and Green for ground.

If you have connectors added inline your cables. Do not have them lying on the floor. Any flooding could allow theses connectors to short causing fire, damage and possibly death. Do not have any cables in areas where you might drop sharp object or move/roll/drive heavy objects over the cables. Ideally cables re run off the floor and thru protective conduit to prevent any accidents. Below are basic Guides for correct wore gauges fore different voltages at 50 amps. This provided only as example and you should consult with a licensed electrician for your specific installation. No responsibility is implied by these basic tables. Gauge size is give for Copper wire/conductor and Aluminum.

Cable lengths will vary depending on the distance from your machine to the power source/wall disconnect.
You will need approximately 4 to 6 feet to run from the transformer to machine electronics enclosure.
